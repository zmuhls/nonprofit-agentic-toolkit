"""Simulation test harness for the Non-Profit AI Toolkit prototype.

Replays scripted user runs against the LIVE app — the same `/api/chat` calls the
browser makes — so each persona exercises the full sequence a real user would walk
through in the browser at the URL in TOOLKIT_BASE_URL (or http://127.0.0.1:8765):

    free-write -> strategic-fit interview -> Entry record -> Red Line Test

Each step is checked against the invariants the app is supposed to hold. Because the
model is live, replies vary run to run, so the checks are keyword-tolerant, not
exact-match.

Usage (start the server first, with OLLAMA_API_KEY set):
    python3 tests/simulate.py                 # all personas
    python3 tests/simulate.py --persona maple # one persona
    python3 tests/simulate.py --verbose       # print fuller model replies
